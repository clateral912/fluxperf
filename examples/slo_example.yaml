# SLO Configuration File Example
# Define performance objectives for calculating Goodput

# SLO name (optional)
name: "Default SLO"

# SLO constraints
# All conditions must be satisfied simultaneously for SLO to be met
constraints:
  # Time to First Token (TTFT) constraint, unit: ms
  ttft_ms:
    max: 200  # TTFT must be less than 200ms

  # Inter-Token Latency (ITL) constraint, unit: ms
  itl_ms:
    max: 100  # Average ITL must be less than 100ms

  # Total latency constraint, unit: ms (optional)
  # latency_ms:
  #   max: 5000

# Other available constraints (commented out are optional):

# Output token throughput constraint, unit: tokens/sec
# output_token_throughput:
#   min: 10  # Output token throughput per request must be greater than 10 tokens/sec
